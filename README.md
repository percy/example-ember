# TodoMVC example application using Ember

This is the example application that's used in [Percy's Ember tutorial](https://percy.io/docs/tutorials/ember).

It's originally a fork of the Ember app from the [TodoMVC project](http://todomvc.com/).

### Getting started

#### Install the application dependencies

Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install) and then run:

```
yarn install
```
